Assuming the houses near the stadium went especially up in price (or down) with a stadium now drawing more traffic to the area, the interaction variable being significant in a linear model would capture this effect. The interest rate and the unemployment rate are included in an attempt to eliminate OVB as the stadium finished construction the same time the housing crash was happening meaning there would be a huge shift in housing prices before and after the stadium regardless of whether there was an impact. The rest of the independent variables are the typical factors used to determine housing prices: size and amenities. "
