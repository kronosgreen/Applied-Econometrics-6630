# Assignment 2

You have been engaged by the Salt Lake County Regional Economic Development office to investigate the effects of building a sports stadium on nearby property values. One component of your analysis will be to evaluate the effects of building the Rio Tinto Stadium (now America First Credit Union Field) in Sandy, UT (home of Real Salt Lake). Did it have an effect on property values?

To prepare your analysis, you have been provided the MLS sales data for Sandy, UT as well as several other nearby suburbs in Salt Lake County. You may choose which of these to include in your analysis.

## Questions

1. Prepare a diagram that describes the relationships between the variables (e.g., the DAG example from class). Are any of the effects that you posit mediated by other variables?
2. Specify the theoretical justification for the functional form you have chosen for your regression model. Do all of the independent variables take the same form?
3. Do your data contain any influential data points? Do you propose addressing them in any way?
4. Does your model show evidence of multicollinearity? If so, is this an issue?
5. Do you find evidence of heteroskedasticity? Compare the standard errors from the regular and asymptotic covariance matrices.
6. If you find evidence of heteroskedasticity, explain the implications and your proposed solution. Does using robust standard errors sufficiently resolve your concerns?
7. Does any economic justification motivate the use of clustered standard errors? If so, explain.
8. Estimate your regression model. Are your results robust to different specifications? (i.e., does the coefficient of your key independent variable vary widely depending on the model you choose?)
9. Are any of your results contrary to expectation? If so, explain.
10. Explain the economic and statistical significance of your key explanatory variable. What conclusion do you draw from these results?
