# Assignment 1

You have been engaged by the Salt Lake County Regional Economic Development office to investigate the effects of building a sports stadium on nearby property values. One component of your analysis will be to evaluate the effects of building the Rio Tinto Stadium (now America First Credit Union Field) in Sandy, UT (home of Real Salt Lake). Did it have an effect on property values?

To prepare your analysis, you have been provided the MLS sales data for Sandy, UT as well as several other nearby suburbs in Salt Lake County. You may choose which of these to include in your analysis.

## Questions

2. Assuming you will use regression analysis to explore this issue, describe the model you propose.
3. What variables do you propose to use? Why? What effect do you expect they will have on your dependent variable? What informs your expectation?
4. Do your data contain all the independent variables you intend to use? If not, what other variables do you need? Where will you get them?
5. Provide a description of your data
    1. What do these data contain?
    2. What do the data not contain that may be of interest?
    3. Time period covered – is the time period sufficient for your analysis
6. Provide a table of univariate statistics for key variables such as price (explain if it’s the sold price or the net price as discussed in class), square footage, acreage, etc.
7. Do any observations indicate they should be deleted? Why?
