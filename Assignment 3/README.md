## Assignment 3

This assignment reflects a two-part overview of the material assigned thus far. Assignment 4 will be the second part. The maximum score for each is 100. Class participation will be added to your score, with the total not to exceed max points.

### Questions

1. Define the term “p-value”.
2. Briefly explain the distinction between the Fisherian and Neyman-Pearson frequentist philosophies.
3. Suppose we want to test the hypothesis that the mean of a sample equals zero. No values lower than zero are possible. Show how the Fisherian and NP frameworks would specify the hypothesis/hypotheses to be tested.
4. “The p-value provides the error rate that we can expect if we repeat the same experiment many times. We then compare the p-value to the maximum error that we are willing to tolerate, e.g., 5%. We call this the alpha level.” Do you agree or disagree with this statement. Explain.
5. “A high R2 values gives us confidence that any out-of-sample prediction will be as accurate as possible. Thus, models with high R2 will necessarily maximize the accuracy of any out-of-sample forecasts that rely upon their results.” Do you agree or disagree with this statement. Explain.
6. Explain the difference between leverage and influence. Does one require the other?
7. What is a working definition of the term outlier? If you find one or more outliers in your data, how do you proceed?
8. Violations of which Gauss-Markov assumptions result in bias? Explain how they do so.
9. Violations of which Gauss-Markov assumptions violate the minimum variance assumptions and complicate significance testing? Explain how they do so.
10. *“A biased estimator has no value and should be disregarded.”* Do you agree or disagree with this statement. Explain.
11. Your model exhibits an R2 of 0.94. However, none of your 5 independent variables are statistically significant. What potential issue does this indicate? What solutions might you offer?
12. You want to test whether your β1 coefficient is different from zero.
    1. Write the formula for the t-statistic.
    2. Now, suppose β1 = 1.2 and SE(β1)= 0.5. Compute the t-statistic.
    3. What is the p-value?
    4. How would you explain the result of this test? What does it tell you about the economic significance of β1?
13. Is the model below linear in the parameters? Suppose β1 = 1.2. Interpret the effect of X on Y.
